# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Python using tkinter


This is the game I developed when I started learning Python in the beggining of 2019. It isn't the best code ever since I didn't even knew what object oriented programming was and I had just stared learning about the language, but it works and it's pretty.
